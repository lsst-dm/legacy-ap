                     this specifies the height of a zone, stripe, and the minimum width of a chunk. 
                     Note that changing this parameter may require repartitioning the Object catalog

                     declination stripe is a declination range that is further subdivided
                     into equal-width chunks. The spatial attributes of objects falling
                     into a given chunk are stored in chunk files. These files are loaded
                     by the association pipeline and used to create spatial indexes for
                     objects known to lie in the FOV for a visit. Note that changing this

                     the association pipeline crossmatch algorithms. Setting this value
                     too high will waste memory, setting it too low will result in
                     excessive memory reallocations when building spatial indexes for
