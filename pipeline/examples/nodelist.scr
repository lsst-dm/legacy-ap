# Format for node list is hostname followed by number of processes to run on that node 
#
# Note: the association pipeline *must* be parallelized by running multiple slices
# on a single machine - each slice expects to be able to communicate with others via
# shared memory. Also, parallelization only makes sense if a single slice
# cannot exhaust available disk IO.
#
# In this example, there is one master process and one worker (slice) process.
