                      of a source S for S to be considered a core-source by the
                      OPTICS algorithm. Core sources are always assigned to a
                      cluster, whereas sources with epsilonArcsec-neighborhoods
                      containing less than minPoints sources may or may not be.
                      If such a source is assigned to a cluster, it is called a
                      border source.  Otherwise, it is called a noise source.
                      This parameter is essentially a lower bound on the number
                      of times an astrophysical object must be detected before
                      its detections are clustered and turned into a catalog
                      entry and can be tuned to avoid generating too many
                      spurious entries. To ensure that every source is assigned
                      to a cluster, set the value to zero. However, setting the
                      value to a non-negligeable fraction of the number of times
                      the sky is covered by the data-set in question will
                      typically result in better clusters. Note though that for
                      now, there is no way to adjust the value to account for
                      data-sets with non uniform coverage."

                      than pointsPerLeaf sources. Since evaluating the angular
                      separation between a query point and a source is 
                      cheaper than tree traversal, a value in the tens of

                      all lie in the neighborhood of a query point. Note also
                      that in this k-d tree implementation, nodes do not store
                      bounding boxes for their contents. Therefore, an entire

                      traversal of its children. So, tiny nodes just waste time."
